Each iCE40 device includes multiple high-speed synchronous EBRs, each 4Kbit in size. 
A single iCE40 device integrates between eight and 32 such blocks. Each EBR is a 256-word deep by 16-bit wide.

EBR Memory Blocks = 30
EBR Memory Bits (kbits) = 120

Each EBR can be configured into a RAM block of size 256x16, 512x8, 1024x4 or 2048x2.

So each block will have 4 Kbits of memory which is 256 x 16bits.

Coeff:     1 EBR - 64 x 16 bits (256 x 16) bits
Shift reg: 1 EBR - 64 x 16 bits (256 x 16) bits

Sample Signal - 2000/256 = 8 EBR

Async FIFO - 1000*2/256 (since we need 32 bit registers so multiply by 2) = 8 EBR

Can I implement 32 bit buffer with this BRAM in ice40up5k along with yosys synthesis tool chain?
