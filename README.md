# Digital-FIR-filter-in-FPGA
Design, Implementation and Validation of Digital Filter on Lattice iCE40UP5k FPGA

This project involves processing the sample signal from a sensor to retrieve the data present in out with the help of a digital filter. 


To perform MAC operations, the FPGA's on board DSP blocks are used. 

Note: This project was developed as part of my project work at TUHH and demonstrates practical skills in FPGA development and signal processing.
